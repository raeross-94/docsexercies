This documentation describes how to safely care for and keep a Mimic in your temple, home, or dungeon.

Mimics make wonderful guardians of treasure and baked goods, but their care and keeping is very important. If you maintain a good environment and treat your Mimic well, you will have a fierce protector for many generations. 

Just watch your fingers! ;)

Before bringing a Mimic into your home, consider how you would like to set up the environment. Mimics do not require much space - only as much room as their perimeter is required. Cool, dark, quiet spaces are prefered, but a Mimic with an extroverted personality might be perfectly happy in a Tavern or Guild Hall.

Once you have selected a space, clear the area and ensure that it is level. This will give your Mimic a comfortable home, and ensure they have a stable platform should the need arise to lunge forward.
